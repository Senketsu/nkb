# Nim Key Binder library (nkb)
This library was made for [Pomf It !](https://github.com/Senketsu/pomfit)

## About:
Basically Nim version of keybinder library for C with added Windows support.*  
***On Windows** it uses the win32 api to register keybinds but saves you from the hasle of using win32 api at all if you choose so.  
(e.g: your application uses GTK exclusively)

Huge credits go to original developers of keybinder.  
Check [keybinder on GitHub](https://github.com/engla/keybinder).

### Usage:
------------------------
** Procedures and description: (If you aren't already familiar with [keybinder](https://github.com/engla/keybinder) )**

* nkb_init()

  Initializes the nkb library , **MUST be called before any other library calls**.


* nkb_set_multi_call (bool)  

  Whether to allow registering multiple callbacks on the same key combination  
  When false, only first registered callback will be called  
  Default: ON  

* nkb_use_cooked (bool)  

  Set wether to use cooked accelerators.  
  Default: OFF  

* nkb_bind(keystring: cstring, handler: PKeybindHandle, user_data: pointer, uID: cuint):  

  Proc to bind a function to a hotkey.  
  **Keystring** must valid gtk accel string e.g `<CTRL>i`  
  **Handler** is a proc pointer of PKeybindHandle type (keystring: cstring, data: pointer)  
  **User_data** will be supplied to handler. Can be nil.  
  **uID** is unique identifier for this hotkey (used only on Windows). Can be ommited. Will be generated if not specified.  
  Returns *bool* value of true if bind was successful.

* nkb_unbind(keystring: cstring, handle: PKeybindHandle)  

  Self descriptive.

* nkb_unbind_all()  

  Unbinds all keybinds.  

### Requirements

This library depends on `gtk2` & `x11` for linux / `oldwinapi` for windows  
packages from the official [Nimble](https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble) repository.
